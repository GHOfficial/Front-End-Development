            <h2>HTML</h2>
            <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
                It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>

            <h2>CSS</h2>
            <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.
                This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics 
                enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be 
                cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>

            <h2>JavaScript</h2>
            <p>JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. 
                While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. 
                JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.</p>

            <h2>ReactJs</h2>
            <p>ReactJS is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building reusable UI components. 
                It is an open-source, component-based front end library responsible only for the view layer of the application. 
                It was created by Jordan Walke, who was a software engineer at Facebook. It was initially developed and maintained by Facebook and was later used in its products like WhatsApp & Instagram. 
                Facebook developed ReactJS in 2011 in its newsfeed section, but it was released to the public in the month of May 2013</p>

                It implements core and optional functionality as a set of TypeScript libraries that you import into your applications.</p>
